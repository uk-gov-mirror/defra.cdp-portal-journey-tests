## Local Development

### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running local tests

Start application you are testing on the url specified in `baseUrl` [wdio.local.conf.js](wdio.local.conf.js)

```bash
npm run test:local
```

### Debugging local tests

```bash
npm run test:local:debug
```

## Production

### Running the tests

Tests are run from the CDP-Portal under the Test Suites section. Before any changes can be run, a new docker image must be built, this will happen automatically when a pull request is merged into the `main` branch.
You can check the progress of the build under the actions section of this repository. Builds typically take around 1-2 minutes.

The results of the test run are made available in the portal.

## Requirements of CDP Environment Tests

1. Your service builds as a docker container using the `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
   The workflow tags the docker images allowing the CDP Portal to identify how the container should be run on the platform.
   It also ensures its published to the correct docker repository.

2. The Dockerfile's entrypoint script should return exit code of 0 if the test suite passes or 1/>0 if it fails

3. Test reports should be published to S3 using the script in `./bin/publish-tests.sh`
